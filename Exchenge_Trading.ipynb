All Rights Reserved\",\n          \"Apple\\u2019s translucent design update for iOS 26, called Liquid Glass, is now available to developers, with a public beta scheduled for next month. The refresh\\u2014Apple\\u2019s first major interface overhaul in 10 years\\u2014makes app icons, buttons, menus, and pop-ups look like they are made of frosted glass, with blurred background colors peeking through.\\nThe sweeping software changes are not just for iPhones. This glassy look\\u2014inspired by the operating system in the Vision Pro headset\\u2014will eventually roll out to the entire suite of Apple devices, from smartwatches to iPads.\\nAfter the WWDC 2025 keynote concluded on Monday, many design-focused developers WIRED spoke with were impressed by the major update but had lingering questions about how this translucent look could impact readability for users.\\n\\u201cIt's hard to read some of it,\\u201d says Allan Yu, a product designer currently building the workplace messaging app Output. \\u201cMainly because I think they made it too transparent.\\u201d Yu suggests bumping up the blurring or adjusting the backgrounds to make onscreen designs more readable.\\n\\u201cSimilar to the first beta for iOS 7, what we\\u2019ve seen so far is rough on the edges and potentially veers into distracting or challenging to read, especially for users with visual impairments,\\u201d says Josh Puckett, cofounder of Iteration, which helps startups with designs. Still, Puckett is optimistic, based on Apple\\u2019s past accessibility features, that readability will improve over time.\\nControls and navigation transform as you interact with the user interface.\\nSerhii Popov, a design-first software engineer at MacPaw, the company behind the CleanMyMac app, is curious to see how the new operating system will look on Macs in bright light situations, where glare already impacts visibility. But overall, Popov is enamored with this \\u201creally fresh\\u201d look from Apple. \\u201cI think it will make everything look bigger and allow you to read or interact with the UI with more comfort,\\u201d says Popov. For him, the new design and updates look especially sleek on iPads.\\nBeyond readability concerns, the first impression from some designers is that this new look could be unnecessarily distracting for users.\\n\\\"From a technical perspective, it's a very impressive effect. I applaud the time and effort it must have taken to mimic refraction and dispersion of light to such a high degree,\\u201d says Adam Whitcroft, a designer at Owner.com, which makes apps and websites for restaurants. \\u201cBut, sadly I haven't seen a single example of where it's pulled off in a way that's complementary to the broader context it's presented in.\\u201d Whitcroft points to the dispersion and refraction of layers beneath the apps as visually distracting, especially as the user interface is changing layouts. \\u201cIf you've designed a UI that draws the attention of the eye away from the wider context, you've gone down the wrong path,\\u201d he says.\\nThe Icon Composer tool for developers lets them create icons with the Liquid Glass aesthetic that remain consistent across various platforms and themes.\\nPuckett\\u2019s initial reaction to the revamp is more positive than Whitcroft\\u2019s. He thinks the shift away from flatness is the right design move. \\u201cI\\u2019m excited that Apple is reintroducing feelings to their digital surfaces, creating interfaces that shimmer, bend, and breathe.\\u201d Puckett hopes this ignites a larger design trend of more expressive, experiential software.\\nNow, the hard part for developers begins: incorporating this new look. As Yu works on building Apple apps, he also appreciates the \\u201cbeautiful\\u201d new aesthetic but is anxious about the feasibility of matching this vibe as a small team. In general, Yu remains unsure about how well Apple\\u2019s new suit is going to fit.\\n\\u201cApple is doing a great job in trying to pull us forward somewhere. It's very brave to do this. I just don't know if the direction is the right place,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIf anyone can do it, Apple can do it. I'm just scrambling to make our designs work.\\u201d\\nLiquid Glass adds subtle changes to FaceTime.\\nThe iOS Photos app with new menus and controls.\\nIn your inbox: WIRED's most ambitious, future-defining stories\\nThere\\u2019s a very simple pattern to Elon Musk\\u2019s broken promises\\nBig Story: The epic rise and fall of a dark-web psychedelics kingpin\\nRejoice!

All Rights Reserved\",\n          \"Apple\\u2019s translucent design update for iOS 26, called Liquid Glass, is now available to developers, with a public beta scheduled for next month. The refresh\\u2014Apple\\u2019s first major interface overhaul in 10 years\\u2014makes app icons, buttons, menus, and pop-ups look like they are made of frosted glass, with blurred background colors peeking through.\\nThe sweeping software changes are not just for iPhones. This glassy look\\u2014inspired by the operating system in the Vision Pro headset\\u2014will eventually roll out to the entire suite of Apple devices, from smartwatches to iPads.\\nAfter the WWDC 2025 keynote concluded on Monday, many design-focused developers WIRED spoke with were impressed by the major update but had lingering questions about how this translucent look could impact readability for users.\\n\\u201cIt's hard to read some of it,\\u201d says Allan Yu, a product designer currently building the workplace messaging app Output. \\u201cMainly because I think they made it too transparent.\\u201d Yu suggests bumping up the blurring or adjusting the backgrounds to make onscreen designs more readable.\\n\\u201cSimilar to the first beta for iOS 7, what we\\u2019ve seen so far is rough on the edges and potentially veers into distracting or challenging to read, especially for users with visual impairments,\\u201d says Josh Puckett, cofounder of Iteration, which helps startups with designs. Still, Puckett is optimistic, based on Apple\\u2019s past accessibility features, that readability will improve over time.\\nControls and navigation transform as you interact with the user interface.\\nSerhii Popov, a design-first software engineer at MacPaw, the company behind the CleanMyMac app, is curious to see how the new operating system will look on Macs in bright light situations, where glare already impacts visibility. But overall, Popov is enamored with this \\u201creally fresh\\u201d look from Apple. \\u201cI think it will make everything look bigger and allow you to read or interact with the UI with more comfort,\\u201d says Popov. For him, the new design and updates look especially sleek on iPads.\\nBeyond readability concerns, the first impression from some designers is that this new look could be unnecessarily distracting for users.\\n\\\"From a technical perspective, it's a very impressive effect. I applaud the time and effort it must have taken to mimic refraction and dispersion of light to such a high degree,\\u201d says Adam Whitcroft, a designer at Owner.com, which makes apps and websites for restaurants. \\u201cBut, sadly I haven't seen a single example of where it's pulled off in a way that's complementary to the broader context it's presented in.\\u201d Whitcroft points to the dispersion and refraction of layers beneath the apps as visually distracting, especially as the user interface is changing layouts. \\u201cIf you've designed a UI that draws the attention of the eye away from the wider context, you've gone down the wrong path,\\u201d he says.\\nThe Icon Composer tool for developers lets them create icons with the Liquid Glass aesthetic that remain consistent across various platforms and themes.\\nPuckett\\u2019s initial reaction to the revamp is more positive than Whitcroft\\u2019s. He thinks the shift away from flatness is the right design move. \\u201cI\\u2019m excited that Apple is reintroducing feelings to their digital surfaces, creating interfaces that shimmer, bend, and breathe.\\u201d Puckett hopes this ignites a larger design trend of more expressive, experiential software.\\nNow, the hard part for developers begins: incorporating this new look. As Yu works on building Apple apps, he also appreciates the \\u201cbeautiful\\u201d new aesthetic but is anxious about the feasibility of matching this vibe as a small team. In general, Yu remains unsure about how well Apple\\u2019s new suit is going to fit.\\n\\u201cApple is doing a great job in trying to pull us forward somewhere. It's very brave to do this. I just don't know if the direction is the right place,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIf anyone can do it, Apple can do it. I'm just scrambling to make our designs work.\\u201d\\nLiquid Glass adds subtle changes to FaceTime.\\nThe iOS Photos app with new menus and controls.\\nIn your inbox: WIRED's most ambitious, future-defining stories\\nThere\\u2019s a very simple pattern to Elon Musk\\u2019s broken promises\\nBig Story: The epic rise and fall of a dark-web psychedelics kingpin\\nRejoice!

All Rights Reserved\",\n          \"Apple\\u2019s translucent design update for iOS 26, called Liquid Glass, is now available to developers, with a public beta scheduled for next month. The refresh\\u2014Apple\\u2019s first major interface overhaul in 10 years\\u2014makes app icons, buttons, menus, and pop-ups look like they are made of frosted glass, with blurred background colors peeking through.\\nThe sweeping software changes are not just for iPhones. This glassy look\\u2014inspired by the operating system in the Vision Pro headset\\u2014will eventually roll out to the entire suite of Apple devices, from smartwatches to iPads.\\nAfter the WWDC 2025 keynote concluded on Monday, many design-focused developers WIRED spoke with were impressed by the major update but had lingering questions about how this translucent look could impact readability for users.\\n\\u201cIt's hard to read some of it,\\u201d says Allan Yu, a product designer currently building the workplace messaging app Output. \\u201cMainly because I think they made it too transparent.\\u201d Yu suggests bumping up the blurring or adjusting the backgrounds to make onscreen designs more readable.\\n\\u201cSimilar to the first beta for iOS 7, what we\\u2019ve seen so far is rough on the edges and potentially veers into distracting or challenging to read, especially for users with visual impairments,\\u201d says Josh Puckett, cofounder of Iteration, which helps startups with designs. Still, Puckett is optimistic, based on Apple\\u2019s past accessibility features, that readability will improve over time.\\nControls and navigation transform as you interact with the user interface.\\nSerhii Popov, a design-first software engineer at MacPaw, the company behind the CleanMyMac app, is curious to see how the new operating system will look on Macs in bright light situations, where glare already impacts visibility. But overall, Popov is enamored with this \\u201creally fresh\\u201d look from Apple. \\u201cI think it will make everything look bigger and allow you to read or interact with the UI with more comfort,\\u201d says Popov. For him, the new design and updates look especially sleek on iPads.\\nBeyond readability concerns, the first impression from some designers is that this new look could be unnecessarily distracting for users.\\n\\\"From a technical perspective, it's a very impressive effect. I applaud the time and effort it must have taken to mimic refraction and dispersion of light to such a high degree,\\u201d says Adam Whitcroft, a designer at Owner.com, which makes apps and websites for restaurants. \\u201cBut, sadly I haven't seen a single example of where it's pulled off in a way that's complementary to the broader context it's presented in.\\u201d Whitcroft points to the dispersion and refraction of layers beneath the apps as visually distracting, especially as the user interface is changing layouts. \\u201cIf you've designed a UI that draws the attention of the eye away from the wider context, you've gone down the wrong path,\\u201d he says.\\nThe Icon Composer tool for developers lets them create icons with the Liquid Glass aesthetic that remain consistent across various platforms and themes.\\nPuckett\\u2019s initial reaction to the revamp is more positive than Whitcroft\\u2019s. He thinks the shift away from flatness is the right design move. \\u201cI\\u2019m excited that Apple is reintroducing feelings to their digital surfaces, creating interfaces that shimmer, bend, and breathe.\\u201d Puckett hopes this ignites a larger design trend of more expressive, experiential software.\\nNow, the hard part for developers begins: incorporating this new look. As Yu works on building Apple apps, he also appreciates the \\u201cbeautiful\\u201d new aesthetic but is anxious about the feasibility of matching this vibe as a small team. In general, Yu remains unsure about how well Apple\\u2019s new suit is going to fit.\\n\\u201cApple is doing a great job in trying to pull us forward somewhere. It's very brave to do this. I just don't know if the direction is the right place,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIf anyone can do it, Apple can do it. I'm just scrambling to make our designs work.\\u201d\\nLiquid Glass adds subtle changes to FaceTime.\\nThe iOS Photos app with new menus and controls.\\nIn your inbox: WIRED's most ambitious, future-defining stories\\nThere\\u2019s a very simple pattern to Elon Musk\\u2019s broken promises\\nBig Story: The epic rise and fall of a dark-web psychedelics kingpin\\nRejoice!

            "### Step 1: Analyze Historical Stock Data\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **General Trend**: We observe from the historical stock data that Apple Inc.'s closing prices have been extremely volatile over the last month. The company experienced a drop below $200 but has rebounded sharply thereafter.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Recent Performance**: In the last week of data, Apple has had a fluctuating yet overall upward trend post a significant drop. The volatility suggests responses to both market conditions and internal events (like product announcements).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Volatility**: The stock fluctuated significantly, suggesting a high degree of uncertainty. The last recorded closing price was $198.419998.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 2: Analyze News Sentiment\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Latest Events**: The news records are rich with sentiment but predominantly neutral. Events such as product launches (WWDC 2025), software updates, and industry competition prevail in the recent headlines.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Majority of the sentiment appears neutral, indicating that there were no overwhelmingly positive or negative spikes in sentiment that could drastically sway the stock price in either direction.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 3: Integrating the Analysis\n",
            "\n",
            "From the observations made:\n",
            "- The sharp recent uptick in price along with the neutral news sentiment suggests that the momentum may be stable but cautious.\n",
            "- Fluctuations in stock price indicate that we may see both potential rebounds and corrections.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 4: Predicting Future Prices\n",
            "\n",
            "To estimate the next 14 days, we assume a slight upward trend while also accounting for potential dips in response to market conditions and sentiments. We apply a modest growth factor that aligns with average stock movements over similar historical periods.\n",
            "\n",
