There are two AI assistants in this project. The First AI assistant gets important links on the website and it will use openai model, the second AI assistant creates a brochure and It will use llama 3.2 model."

      "**Code Explanation**\n",
      "\n",
      "This line of code uses a combination of Python features to extract author names from a list of dictionaries (`books`) and yield them one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "* `{book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}`: This is a generator expression.\n",
      "\t+ `for book in books`: Iterates over each dictionary (`book`) in the `books` list.\n",
      "\t+ `if book.get(\"author\")`: Filters out dictionaries that don't have an \"author\" key or value.\n",
      "\t+ `book.get(\"author\")`: Retrieves and yields the value associated with the \"author\" key for each remaining dictionary.\n",
      "\n",
      "* `yield from ...`: This keyword is used to yield values from a sub-generator (the generator expression). It's like saying \"give me all the values generated by the sub-generator, one at a time\".\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when combined, this line of code yields author names from dictionaries in the `books` list, but only for those that have an \"author\" key.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Use Case**\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose you have a list of books with their metadata:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "books = [\n",
      "    {\"title\": \"Book 1\", \"author\": \"Author A\"},\n",
      "    {\"title\": \"Book 2\", \"author\": \"Author B\"},\n",
      "    {\"title\": \"Book 3\"}\n",
      "]\n",
      "```\n",
      "Using this code, the resulting generator would yield author names in this order:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "Author A\n",
      "Author B\n",
      "```\n",
      "The `yield from` syntax allows you to easily extract specific data from a nested or complex structure, making it a useful tool for handling hierarchical data.\n"
